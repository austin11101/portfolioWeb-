        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I have extensive experience with RESTful APIs, which are essential for building scalable and maintainable web services. My skills include designing API endpoints, handling HTTP requests and responses, and ensuring robust and secure data exchanges. I have worked with various tools and frameworks to create APIs that are efficient and easy to integrate with other systems.</p>
