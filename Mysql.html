        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I have extensive experience with SQL, the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. My expertise includes designing efficient database schemas, writing complex queries, and optimizing database performance. I have utilized SQL in various projects to manage data, ensure data integrity, and support data-driven applications.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Project 1: E-Commerce Database Management<br>
                Designed and implemented a relational database for an e-commerce platform. Created tables, relationships, and indexes to support product listings, user accounts, and order processing. Optimized queries to improve performance and reduce load times.</li>
            <li>Project 2: Data Migration and ETL Processes<br>
                Led data migration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for a large-scale data integration project. Wrote SQL scripts to extract data from legacy systems, transform it to fit the new schema, and load it into the target database.</li>
            <li>Project 3: Analytics and Reporting<br>
                Developed complex SQL queries and stored procedures for generating reports and performing data analysis. Implemented views and aggregate functions to provide actionable insights and support business decision-making.</li>
