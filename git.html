        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I have extensive experience with Git, the widely used version control system, which has been an integral part of my development workflow. Over the years, I've utilized Git for managing code versions, collaborating with teams, and maintaining a clean and organized project history. My proficiency in Git allows me to handle complex branching, merging, and resolving conflicts efficiently.</p>
